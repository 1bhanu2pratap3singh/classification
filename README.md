# classification
The given code is written in Python and it is used to build a predictive model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not.
The first few lines of code are used to import the required libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib. After that, it reads the train.csv and test.csv files and stores them in the 'train' and 'test' variables, respectively.

Then, we explore the features present in the train dataset by using the 'train.columns' and 'train.shape' commands. The output shows that there are 17 independent variables and 1 target variable in the train dataset. The extra column present in train is subscribed, which is the target variable that we are trying to predict using the model built with the train data.

Next, we look at the data types of the variables present in the train dataset using the 'train.dtypes' command. It shows that some variables are of object type, which means they are categorical variables, while some variables are of int64 type, which represents the integer variables.

After that, we print the first few rows of the train dataset using the 'train.head()' command.

we then performs univariate analysis to explore the distribution of the target variable using the 'train['subscribed'].value_counts()' command. It shows the frequency of the target variable, which is subscribed. The 'normalize=True' parameter is used to print proportions instead of numbers, and the 'train['subscribed'].value_counts().plot.bar()' command is used to plot the bar plot of frequencies.

we then performs bivariate analysis to explore the relationship between the independent variables and the target variable using the 'pd.crosstab()' and 'plot()' commands. It shows how the target variable varies with different independent variables such as job, default, etc.

After that, we looks at the correlation between the numerical variables using the 'train.corr()' and 'sn.heatmap()' commands. It shows the correlation between each of these variables, and the variables with high negative or positive values are considered to be correlated.

we then checks for any missing values in the train dataset using the 'train.isnull().sum()' command.

Finally, we starts to build the predictive model using the scikit-learn library. It converts the categorical variables to numerical variables using the 'pd.get_dummies()' command and then splits the train dataset into the train and test sets using the 'train_test_split()' command. After that, it uses different models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN to build the predictive model and compares their accuracy scores to choose the best model for prediction.
